    "Wa-Tor is a population dynamics simulation described by Alexander Dewdney in Scientific American (1984): \"Computer Recreations: Sharks and fish wage an ecological war on the toroidal planet Wa-Tor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The details were described in previous lectures. In this asignment we will combine what we learned about Wator and OOP concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of Wa-Tor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Wa-Tor world consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells which may be empty, contain a fish or contain a shark. The grid wraps top-to-bottom and left-to-right so may also be thought of as a torus (hence Wa-Tor).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time progresses in discrete time intervals. At each time interval, each creature's state evolves according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Each fish moves randomly to an adjacent cell; if the cells are all occupied, it doesn't move;\n",
    "\n",
    "    * After a fish has survived a fixed number of time intervals (fertility_threshold in the code below), it reproduces by leaving another fish behind on its previous cell after it moves. Afterwards, its fertility is reset to zero;\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Each shark moves randomly to an adjacent cell occupied by a fish and gains a certain amount of energy in doing so (by \"eating\" the fish); if the adjacent cells are all empty, it moves into one of them at random; if the adjacent cells are full of sharks, it doesn't move;\n",
    "\n",
    "    * After every time interval, each shark loses one unit of energy. If a shark's energy reaches zero, it dies;\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Once a shark has reached its own fertility threshold, it reproduces in the same manner as the fish.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Go over the code__. Most of it should be familiar since the details were discussed in previous lectures. The provided code, however, is written using and object oriented approach. So, rather than having a function that creates fish or sharks we have a __class__ that combines both and differentiates them using a pre-defined ID. Note this is not the only way to write Wa-Tor using the OOP paradigm - there are many other (likely better) ways to do it but this is just one way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code makes heavy use of __list comprehensions__. These have not been discussed in class but they are easy to understand: they are just shorcuts to create lists. There is plenty of information on the web but you can start here: \n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The code below produces a sequence of PNG files which can be converted into an animation using ffmpeg or ImageMagick's convert. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The simulation parameters can be modified. However, some care is needed to adjust the simulation parameters to avoid the common outcomes of (a) extinction of all species (first the sharks eat all the fish, then they die of starvation) or (b) extinction of all the sharks (too few fish to begin with so the sharks die out before the fish breed to saturation).\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exercise 1 Modify the \"MAIN PROGRAM\" (see below) so that the simulation is displayed __inline__ so you need to use the __show_world()__ method. Run and save the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exercise 2 Modify the \"MAIN PROGRAM\" again. This time you want to generate the __PNG__ files so use the __save_world()__ method. Modify as required to save the PNG files. With the current settings the program will generate 80 PNG files (about 2KB each). Do a web search and learn how to create an __animation__ using the generated PNG images. Submit the resulting animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Submit the notebook with your changes as well as the resulting animation (it should be an MP4 or GIF file)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with the code. This code is designed to produce animations (like the original Wa-Tor) but it could be modified to provide data to plot time series and phase space plots."
